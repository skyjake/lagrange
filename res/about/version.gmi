# Release notes

## 1.17.6
* Fixed memory leak: fetched pages were not always released from memory (reference miscount). 
* Fixed minor memory leak in list widgets.
* Gopher: Autodetect Gemtext files based on file extension.
* Updated UI translations.

## 1.17.5
* Fixed a few small memory leaks.
* Fixed unnecessary copying of data while waiting for an audio buffer to become playable.
* Gopher: Detect audio media type from file extension with the `s` item type (it's not always WAV).
* Content that uses `charset=utf-8` is checked for validity. If the encoding is invalid, the content is instead decoded as CP437 (if it has ANSI escapes; possibly it's ASCII art) or just Latin-1.
* Remove ANSI escapes from window titles.
* Modified rule for when 'text/plain' is assumed to actually be 'text/gemini' based on the file extension.

## 1.17.4
* Removed automatic horizontal scrolling of wide preformatted blocks. Instead, hold down the Shift key to scroll horizontally with the mouse wheel.
* Fixed an event processing issue where some events were not handled as expected, for instance when opening a link into split view the opened link was not highlighted.
* Fixed links not reacting to mouse hover after jumping to a heading from the Outline.
* Fixed input prompt behaving strangely after changing font size. (Lines are now forced to rewrap after changing the font.)
* Fixed mouse cursor not changing its shape in all open windows.
* Updated UI translations.

## 1.17.3
* Fixed activating a pinned identity when opening a bookmark via the Bookmarks menu.
* Fixed initial scope of a created identity when using the default selection.
* Fixed issues with dropdown menus when the menu appears as a popup window.
* Fixed clearing the pinned identity of a bookmark.

## 1.17.2
* Tabs opened in background are immediately added to the URL history.

* Fixed long bookmark titles making the Bookmarks menu too wide.
* ANSI Cursor Forward control sequence ("CSI n C") is converted to a series of spaces, but only in preformatted text.
* Fixed parsing of ANSI SGR sequences with many attributes concatenated (e.g., 0;1;40;30).
* Fixed inline image loading indicator overdrawing itself, becoming unreadable.
* Windows: Installer restarts the app after updating, and there is a checkbox for launching the app if it wasn't running. The uninstaller is now signed, too.
* Updated UI translations.

## 1.17.1
* Added "Vibrant Light" color theme.
* Improved readability of "Colorful Light" headings.
* Tuned autoscrolling when selecting text to avoid accidental scrolling.
* Preformatted blocks no longer switch to a smaller font to fit to the page.
* Mouse wheel scrolls a wide preformatted block when hovering over the block, instead of scrolling vertically. You can hold the Shift key to swap the scroll direction.
* Fixed horizontal scrolling issues with preformatted blocks: only scroll if needed, allow scrolling anywhere on the block and not just on non-empty text lines, and when scrolling disallow swipe navigation over the area.
* Fixed visual artifacts around and next to preformatted blocks (e.g., streaking).
* Fixed potential crash after (un)folding a preformatted block.
* Fixed links being non-clickable after searching text on a page has scrolled the view.

## 1.17
⚠️ Caps Lock is no longer treated as a modifier key in keybindings. Use `--capslock` to enable it.

New features:
* The Bookmarks menu lists all of your bookmarks and folders.
* Snippets: A collection of short text segments that can be pasted into any input field via the context menu. For example, useful for your gemlog header/footer and other often-repeated parts.
* Snippets can be managed in Preferences > Snippets and created by right-clicking on links or selected text on a page.
* Custom search queries: Snippets whose name starts with a bang (e.g., "!w") can be invoked in the URL field to make customized queries. The snippet content should be a Gemini search URL, for example: "gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi/search".
* Quick lookup shows matching snippets as a new type of search result.
* Keyboard shortcut Shift+1/⇧1 for conveniently making a snippet query.
* Input prompts, upload dialogs, and bookmark editors can be resized by dragging the left or right edge.
* Text zooming in the upload text editor.
* Gemtext syntax highlighting in the upload dialog.
* Recently submitted input prompt contents are saved persistently and can be restored via the Ellipsis utility menu in the prompt dialog.
* You can force the input prompt to appear before a certain URL is requested so you can enter a query string. This is useful for avoiding an extra request when it is known that a URL will require input (e.g., search engine, game input).
* When importing links as bookmarks, you can optionally create subfolders from headings. You can also choose a destination folder for the imported bookmarks.
* Quickly add/move a bookmark into a folder with the navbar bookmark button context menu (right-click on 🏷️).
* User-selectable feed refresh interval. Previously the interval been hardcoded to four hours. (Based on a patch by Michael Nordmeyer.)
* Setting to never/always collapse preformatted blocks, disabling the ability to toggle the folding.
* "Fold All" and "Unfold All" in Bookmarks sidebar context menu.
* "Search" context menu item on selected text to make a search query with it.
* "Use as Search URL" in link context menu.
* "Mark All Links as Visited" in the Tools submenu.
* Option `--capslock`: enable Caps Lock as a modifier in keybindings.
* Option `--theme` (`-t`): change UI color theme of open Lagrange windows. Can be used in scripts to switch the theme automatically (for example, see the `darkman` utility; thanks to Jason McBrayer for suggesting this).
* Support for the Nex protocol (nex://nightfall.city/nex/info/specification.txt).
* Keyboard shortcut for deleting bookmarks (Backspace). Useful when the Bookmarks list has input focus.
* macOS: System UI accent color can be chosen as the accent color.

Changes and enhancements:
* Menus can have submenus. Several of the old menus were reorganized accordingly. For example, the page context menu has a Tools submenu for translation, Titan uploads, etc.
* Show unsupported media types as plain text if the content is valid UTF-8 encoded text.
* The page scrolls while selecting text near top/bottom.
* Display a logo graphic in empty windows/tabs as a placeholder.

* Adjusted colors of the Import Identity dialog.
* Auto-hide sidebars when resizing a window/split if the document area would become narrower than the sidebar.
* Tuned theme color palette and improved background colors of "Colorful Light".
* Newly created client certificates have a default expiration date in the year 9999, which means they won't expire. One can still also set a specific date as before.
* Periodically save UI state (including each tab's navigation history) to prevent data loss in case the app crashes. These runtime saves do not include any cached page content. The full cache is still saved as before when quitting the app.

Fixes:
* Potential crash at shutdown when a feed update is ongoing.
* Problems with window refresh when multiple windows are open. For example, the cursor not blinking in input fields.
* Incorrect name displayed in page banner when URL query string contains a tilde name.
* Fixed navbar spinner animation going too fast when both sides of a split view are being loaded.
* Glitches during swipe navigation (touch screens, macOS trackpad). Behavior is more robust at ends of history and when content is not immediately available in cache.
* Fixed opening of context menus via keyboard (incorrect click position).
* Fixed a text rendering issue where glyphs were incorrect when preceded by a Narrow No-Break Space.

## 1.16.7

## 1.16.5
* "New Tab" (Ctrl+T/⌘T) and the tab bar [+] button append the tab to the right edge. Previously it was inserted next to the active tab.
* Flatpak: Fixed crash when opening Preferences.

## 1.16.4

* Fixed incorrect mouse button state and other potential incorrect behavior after resizing the window.
* macOS: Fixed drag operation getting stuck if a context menu is opened during the drag.
* macOS: Fixed a few cases of potential window freezing during swipe navigation.

## 1.16
New features:
* Input prompt font size can be changed with the Zoom In/Out/Reset keys.

* Preferences: Moved cache/memory size settings to Content tab.
* Page title in margin omits prefix Emoji if it matches the bookmark icon.
* Adjusted word-wrapping to break at a period inside a word (e.g., domain names).

* Move a tab to the other side of a split view (tab context menu).
* Move a tab to a new window (tab context menu).
* Added a "Window" menu to the menu bar that has actions for manipulating and switching the active window, and duplicating and switching tabs. (On macOS, this menu has already been available.)

* Updated UI translations.

## 1.14
New features:
* A bookmark folder can be opened in new tabs, in the same window or a new one, one tab per bookmark.
* Pinned bookmark identities. A simpler way to use identities. When the "Pinned identity" property is set on a bookmark, opening the bookmark causes the selected identity to be "pinned" to the tab: while you stay on the same site, the identity remains in use when opening links. However, when opening a link to another site, a new tab gets opened. (The old way of per-URL identities is still available, too.)
* New identities can be created for use in the current directory (as opposed to domain or page).
* Option `--dump` (`-d`) to print contents of URLs/paths to stdout. Metadata is printed to stderr.
* Option `--dump-identity` (`-I`) selects the identity to use with `--dump`.
* Option `--replace-tab URL` opens a URL, replacing contents of the active tab.
* Option `--user DIR` (`-U`) to set the directory where user data is stored.

Changes and enhancements:
* When creating new identities, make it clearer what the scope of usage will be. The UI actions explicitly say "New Identity for Domain" when the default usage will be the entire domain.
* URLs opened via system-level handlers always open a new tab, like URLs opened via the command line.
* MIME types of many new file extensions are recognized (courtesy of John Cowan).
* The regular expression library PCRE2 is preferred over PCRE, if available. The older library is in maintenance mode.
* Updated UI translations.

Fixes:
* Accidental backwards navigation when quickly refreshing the page twice.
* Page scroll position is kept when loading finishes, if the user already scrolled during loading.
* Schemeless relative URLs no longer assume "gemini" as the scheme, instead using the current page's scheme as default.
* Opening a feed entry in a background tab will mark is as read, like opening in the foreground does.
* ANSI escapes 39 and 49 (reset FG/BG color to default) were not working.

## 1.13.8

* Fixed reporting of errors related to a proxy server certificate.
* An untrusted proxy server certificate can be trusted via Page Information.
* Updated UI translations.

## 1.13.6
* Added option to split tabs evenly, excluding sidebar widths (default: no).
* Fixed crash when switching view to plain text.
* Fixed manually entered image URLs inadvertently opening inline.
* Fixed mouse event handling in split view mode when a dialog is open on one side. The other side would not receive wheel events unless input focus was first switched over.
* Fixed issues with popup menu positioning.
* Fixed drawing of the widget scroll indicator when a widget doesn't fit vertically in the window.
* Possible workaround for an issue with mouse hover autoscrolling on an external displays.

* Percent-encode backslashes in externally opened URLs, for improved compatibility.
* Custom link icons are allowed with unsupported/unrecognized protocols (i.e., Emoji at the start of link label).
* Use file name as the tab/window title if the content has no headings.
* Avoid redundancy in tab/window titles ("Cosmos — Cosmos" → "Cosmos").
* macOS: Fixed a sidebar animation glitch when in split view mode.
* macOS: Adjusted idle UI refresh rate when using the Metal backend, to avoid stutters.
* Updated UI translations.

## 1.13.5
* Parent navigation assumes directory URL is equivalent to index page URL (e.g., "/path/" == "/path/index.gmi"): this now only applies to Gemini URLs, and checks for "index.gemini", too, as per Gemini Best Practices.
* Fixed crash when determining the name of a ZIP file from a URL.
* Fixed misparsing of URL to form the name of a downloaded file (`%23` decoded too early).
* macOS: Fixed window state being forgotten when all windows are closed. Normally state is saved when quitting, but on macOS the app will keep running without any windows.
* TUI: Added "Simple characters" setting (in Preferences > Fonts) that replaces selected Unicode symbols with ASCII approximations.
* TUI: Level 1 headings are two lines tall and underlined.
* TUI: Don't load any fontpacks.

## 1.13.2
* Fixed failure to restore the selected fonts at launch.
* Fixed window state being reset when quitting the app by closing the last window. (No such problem was occurring when quitting via menu or Ctrl+Q.)

## 1.13.1
* Fixed crash when opening Preferences. The text renderer had problems with font lookup.

## 1.13
New features:
* Curses-based `clagrange` for running the app in the terminal. This is a complete TUI port of the original GUI version including, e.g., UI animations, smooth scrolling, and split view mode. `clagrange` has separate preferences, UI state, and key bindings but the rest of the runtime files are shared with the GUI version.
* Build option `ENABLE_TUI`: build a text mode version of the app so it can be run in the terminal. Enabling this produces an executable called `clagrange` that is not linked with SDL.
* URL field indicator that shows if there's a bookmark for the current page. Clicking on the indicator opens the Add/Edit Bookmark dialog.
* Checking server certificates using a bundled root CA file.
* Build option `CACERT_PEM_PATH`: path of a cacert.pem file that contains trusted root CA certificates. This file is included in resources.lgr.
* Support for the Spartan protocol. Prompt lines will open an input dialog for submitting text. This can be expanded to the full upload dialog using which a file can be uploaded, too.
* Reopening the last closed tab. The default binding is Shift+Ctrl+T (⇧⌘T).
* Page context menu item "View as Plain Text": show the page source as plain text.
* Option to view Markdown as source or as a Gemtext conversion (default: as source).

Changes and enhancements:
* Updated Noto Emoji font with support for Unicode 14. There should be no more missing Emoji glyphs.
* Improved UI keyboard navigation. The sidebar and all widgets in dialogs are accessible via Tab cycling, and new shortcuts have been added for opening menus. Menu items and lists are cursor-navigable. Opening the sidebar automatically gives it keyboard focus.
* When bookmarking a page, show the Edit Bookmark dialog if there's already a bookmark for the URL. The Edit Bookmark dialog has a new Duplicate button for actually making a duplicate bookmark.
* Markdown documents support horizontal rules.
* TUI: Zoom controls resize the open sidebar (left sidebar if both visible).

Fixes:
* Sidebar page outline not updated when the current tab changes.
* The Escape key closes the bookmark editor dialog as intended.
* Preferences: "Justify" option must be hidden if HarfBuzz is not used.
* macOS: Window refresh tweaks to avoid stutters (Metal renderer).

## 1.12.2
* Fixed positioning of the language translation dialog's progress animation.
* Fixed hovering on links via the keyboard (default binding: H).

* Updated UI translations.

## 1.12
New features:
* Export and import user data as a ZIP archive, including identities, bookmarks, site-specific settings, trusted certificate fingerprints, and browsing history.
* UI layout options: the navigation/tab bars can be moved to the bottom of the window, and one can have a traditional menu bar instead of the hamburger menu. On macOS, the normal menu bar is used as before.
* Added style option to justify paragraphs that are at least three lines long.
* Added new content theme "Oceanic" with support for both dark and light modes.
* Added new UI accent colors: Red, Green, Blue, Gray.

* macOS: A set of system fonts is available for use in content/UI. In practice, these are .ttc files loaded from /System/Library/Fonts/, rendered using Lagrange's own text renderer.
* Site-specific setting for TLS session resumption (enabled by default).

Changes and enhancements:
* Roboto is the new default content/UI font, except on Windows where Segoe UI is the default font.
* Toggles use symbols instead of YES/NO.
* UI uses only one accent color at a time.
* Theme palette tuning: adjusted generated palettes of Colorful Dark/Light, improved the Sepia theme, and added a dark mode Sepia variant.
* Certain pages like Help open in a new tab. If the page is already open in a tab, that tab is activated instead of opening a new one.
* Improved word wrapping with more breaking punctuation.
* Text renderer uses additional subpixel offsets with lower-density displays.
* Text rendering optimizations: avoid repeated shaping of the same text.

* Updated UI translations.

## 1.11.1
* Fixed opening bookmarks in a new window.
* Fixed use of a cached TLS session after deactivating a client certificate.

## 1.11
⚠️ Downgrading back to v1.10 causes all site-specific themes to be forgotten. Back up your sitespec.ini beforehand.

New features:
* Multiple windows. Windows can be opened via the menu, Ctrl/⌘+N, or link context menus.
* Restoring tabs at launch is now optional. Added a toggle in Preferences > General.
* Site-specific settings (Shift+Ctrl/⌘+Comma), with options for theme customization and showing ANSI escape warnings. The custom theme is based on a "seed string" chosen by the user.
* Fontpack search. Fonts in the skyjake.fi font library have been indexed based on all the glyphs they provide, so one can look up which fontpacks provide any missing glyphs.
* "Manage Fonts" button on the Preferences > Fonts tab. It opens "about:fonts".
* "Tab width" setting (default: 8). This controls how TAB characters are displayed on pages.
* Setting for maximum valid URI length on 'text/gemini' link lines.
* Option to show images decoded from data URLs immediately after loading a page. This is limited to JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF (no animations).
* "Paste and Go" in the input field context menu.
* TLS session caching: reduces the need for redundant handshaking by keeping old TLS sessions cached for 10 minutes.
* UI language for Italian.

* Input field backup is done per window, e.g., "uploadbackup.2.txt".
* Sidebar context menus have more consistent "open" menu items, now including opening the item in a new window.
* The missing glyphs warning dialog now shows a list of the missing code points.
* Downloading the Classic Set fontpack is no longer suggested since fontpacks can be searched as needed.
* Abbreviate font pack descriptions on "about:fonts". The full description is shown when viewing a single fontpack.
* The active tab button uses the theme background color if the page color theme has a bright colorful background to avoid clashing with the UI accent color.
* Adjusted colors of the Gray and Black page themes.
* Added additional (small) variations to theme hues.
* Data URLs have their own link icon.
* Adjusted appearance of context menus.
* Updated UI translations.

Fixes:
* Incorrect behavior and UI glitches related to data URLs. The UI will now omit the encoded part of data URLs.
* Occasional mismatch between page and banner backgrounds. It was due to loss of precision when converting colors to 8-bit RGB.
* Issues with changing UI metrics when a window moves between displays. Not all UI elements were rescaled properly.
* Glitches with opening and closing context menus.
* TAB characters are no longer forcibly normalized to spaces.
* Pasting LF characters in the URL field should not be possible.
* Avoid reinitializing fonts more than once during startup.
